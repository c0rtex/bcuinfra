[{"DISPLAY_ID":92551,"DISPLAY_TEXT":"Social Security Retirement is a monthly benefit that workers receive from the Social Security Administration if they have worked for a certain number of years and paid Social Security (FICA) taxes. To receive this benefit, you must reach the retirement age and file for benefits.  There is a full retirement age and an early retirement age. If you retire early you will receive reduced benefits for as long as you collect Social Security. Your surviving spouse may also collect benefits on your record after you are deceased. She or he may collect these benefits as early as age 60.","LANGUAGE_ID":"EN"}]
