[{"DISPLAY_ID":92218,"DISPLAY_TEXT":"Nursing homes and Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) provide care to people for short-term stays and long-term care. An SNF is a Medicare-regulated nursing facility that provides medical care and rehabilitation services that can only be provided by a nurse or doctor. People may need skilled care or rehabilitation for a short time after a hospital visit. Most SNFs are also nursing homes providing non-medical, custodial care for people with disabilities and chronic conditions. A nursing facility is not the same as an assisted living facility.","LANGUAGE_ID":"EN"}]
