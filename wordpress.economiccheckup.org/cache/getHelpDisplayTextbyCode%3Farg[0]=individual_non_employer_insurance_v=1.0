[{"DISPLAY_ID":92577,"DISPLAY_TEXT":"Individual insurance is insurance that is not offered by your employer that you purchase by yourself. The Affordable Care Act created a new way for individuals to shop for insurance plans: the Health Insurance Exchanges, also called the Health Insurance Marketplace. The Marketplace is a website that allows you to compare insurance plans and purchase them online. Each state has its own Marketplace, and may call its Marketplace by a different name. You may have purchased your plan through an Exchange or you may have purchased it outside of the Exchanges (such as through a broker).","LANGUAGE_ID":"EN"}]
