[{"DISPLAY_ID":92549,"DISPLAY_TEXT":"Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are a type of savings account that is only available to people who have high deductible health plans. People with HSAs can contribute money to their accounts to save for future medical expenses or to pay for health care before they have met their deductible. The money taken out will not be taxed if it is used for qualified medical expenses. An HSA is different than a Flexible Spending Account (FSA). All of the money in an HSA carries over from year to year. In many cases, you must use all of the funds in your FSA by the end of the year. In addition, you do not have to have a high deductible health plan to have an FSA.","LANGUAGE_ID":"EN"}]
