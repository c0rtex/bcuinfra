Analyzes your Role Scoper installation for Press Permit import / configuration compatibility.

== Description ==

Role Scoper is a versatile access control solution, available since May 2008 and on wordpress.org since March 2009.  Although a popular download, it has solicited feature, improvement and support requests which proved unsustainable under the purely free plugin model.  Meanwhile, through years of development the author identified convoluting factors in the sofware architecture, permissions model and corresponding database schema.

To address these shortcomings and improvement requests, Kevin decided to start fresh with a new code base and funding model - launching <a href="http://presspermit.com">Press Permit</a> in November 2011. Derived from Role Scoper, it keeps the orginal plugin's best features while gutting the most glaring inefficiencies and introducing a more straightforward permissions model. The agressive refactoring also removed some of the more obscure and poorly implemented features. For details, see the <a href="http://presspermit.com/pp-rs-feature-grid">RS-PP Feature Grid</a>.

= Press Permit is released and supported on a Core + Pro model =
* Press Permit Core is distributed free of charge on wordpress.org
* Press Permit Pro provides access to extension plugins (including an import tool), API documentation and basic support in the member forums
* The author has blocked off regular consulting hours for extended support and feature development

The purpose of Role Scoper Upgrade Advisor is to identify which elements of your Role Scoper installation would be handled by Press Permit Core / Press Permit Pro and what level of automation is available for that conversion.

== Installation ==

Role Scoper Upgrade Advisor can be installed automatically via the Plugins tab in your blog administration panel.

= To install manually instead: =
1. Upload `role-scoper-upgrade-advisor&#95;?.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Extract `role-scoper-upgrade-advisor&#95;?.zip` into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I just keep using Role Scoper? =

Role Scoper is being phased out. Unfunded feature development has ended and basic support will continue through 3.6.x only. Compatibility with WordPress 3.7 and beyond is not assured.

= Why can't you just keep developing Role Scoper? =

The code base and funding model both needed an overhaul.

= Doesn't this mean you're abandoning users after years? =

No, given minimal funding and unrelenting improvement/support demands, this was the only way I could avoid abandoning you. This move was necessary on both financial and personal levels.
