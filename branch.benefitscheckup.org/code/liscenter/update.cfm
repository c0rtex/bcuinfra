<h3 align="center"> SSA Updating Extra Help Online Application </h3>
<p align="center">The Social Security Administration (SSA) is in the process of making changes to its online application for Extra Help with Medicare Prescription Drug Costs.&nbsp; As a result, we are simultaneously making changes to the LIS Center to ensure that all Extra Help applications processed through BenefitsCheckUp are processed with SSA's changes in place. <br>
    <br>
  If you want to submit an LIS application today, please <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/prescriptionhelp/" target="_blank">click here<a/> to submit an online LIS Application on the SSA web site. During this short transition period, applications processed directly through SSA will not be counted in the statistics for your Organizational Edition of BenefitsCheckUp.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Reminder: You will need to update your paper LIS applications to accommodate SSA's changes too.</strong><br>
    <br>
  If you have questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@benefitscheckup.org">support@benefitscheckup.org</a>.</p>
