<a NAME="start"></a><p><br><i><b><font color="Black" size="4">
Q:&nbsp&nbsp What do I need to do to start receiving the benefits?</i></b><br>
</font><font color="Black" size="3"><b><p>
A:&nbsp&nbsp <cf_tagBCU> provides you with contact information for each benefit program listed on the Program Details Pages on the screen and in the Eligibility Report. We recommend that you first contact the organizations to discuss your individual situation and obtain the required application materials. Then complete the application and deliver it to the appropriate agency (remembering to bring with you any required information or materials). Typically, it takes one to two weeks for a government agency to process your application. If after that time you haven't heard anything, we recommend that you contact them to see where your application is in the system.
</p><p>
Remember, <cf_tagBCU> identifies programs that you should investigate further.  It does not determine whether or not you shall receive benefits nor does it enroll you in any benefit programs. It is your responsibility to apply for all programs.&nbsp&nbsp <cfinclude template="back2faq.cfm"></font>

<a NAME="browser"></a><p><br><i><b><font face="arial" color="Black" size="4">
Q:&nbsp&nbsp Does it matter which browser or version I use?</i></b>
</font></i></p><p><font face="arial" color="Black" size="3"><b>
A:&nbsp&nbsp No, it doesn't matter which browser (Netscape Communicator or Microsoft Internet Explorer), but it is important to use browsers greater than version 4.  This is because <cf_tagBCU> takes advantage of some technologies developed in later versions to make the site more user-friendly and efficient.&nbsp&nbsp <cfinclude template="back2faq.cfm">

</b></font></p>
<p>
<a NAME="multiple"></a><p><br><i><font face="arial" color="Black" size="4"><b>
Q:&nbsp&nbsp Can I view <cf_tagBCU> using multiple browser windows?</i></b><br>
</font></b></p><p><font face="arial" color="Black" size="3"><b>
A:&nbsp&nbsp No. Using multiple browser windows throws off the user's progress through the site. The system is designed to easily and efficiently guide one user session through the service at a time. Multiple, simultaneous sessions (using multiple browser windows) may cause the browser to fail, cause a system error or return inaccurate results. Make sure that only one browser window is open while using this service.&nbsp&nbsp <cfinclude template="back2faq.cfm">
</b></font></p>

<p>
<a NAME="limit"></a></p><p><br><i><b><font face="arial" color="Black" size="4">
Q:&nbsp&nbsp What is a Session Time Limit?  And why did I get one?</i></b><br>
</font></p><p><font face="arial" color="Black" size="3"><b>
A:&nbsp&nbsp Each time a person uses the service, it's called a session. The session begins the moment the user arrives at the home page and continues until the person exits the site. However, there is one exception: a session may end, if after 20 minutes there hasn't been any activity by the user (no mouse clicks or no keyboard activity). When a session is started, it blocks a certain portion of the system's resources thus limiting the number of users at any one time.  The time limit allows the system to ensure that the maximum amount of resources are available for active users.  
<p>
If you receive the "Session Timed Out" notice, that means you have not had any activity in the last 20 minutes. Simply start over and everything will be fine.&nbsp&nbsp <cfinclude template="back2faq.cfm"></font>
</b></font>
<p>
<a NAME="navigate"></a></p><p><br><i><b><font face="arial" color="Black" size="4">
Q:&nbsp&nbsp What's the best way to navigate through <cf_tagBCU>?</i></b><br>
</font></p><p><font face="arial" color="Black" size="3"><b>
A:&nbsp&nbsp It's best to start from the beginning of <cf_tagBCU> and go all the way through the service. While it's possible to use your browser's back and forward buttons to review your answers, these actions may disturb the dynamic nature of the question generation. If it is necessary to go back and change information, then be prepared to re-enter some information. However, if you click on a link and leave the <cf_tagBCU> site then you must use your browser's "Back Button" to return.
</p></b></font><font face="arial" color="Black" size="3"><b>
Therefore, it's recommended that you use the navigation supplied by the service and travel in that direction only.&nbsp&nbsp <cfinclude template="back2faq.cfm">  </font>
</font></p>
<p>
<a NAME="answers"></a></p><p><br><i><b><font face="arial" color="Black" size="4">
Q:&nbsp&nbsp Is there a way that I can review my answers?</i></b><br>
</font></p><p><font face="arial" color="Black" size="3"><b>
A:&nbsp&nbsp Yes.  On the Results Overview page at the completion of the questionnaire, there is an option to "Review Answers."  A pop-up window will appear displaying your answers.  It is not possible to change answers on this page.&nbsp&nbsp <cfinclude template="back2faq.cfm"></font>
</b></font>
<p>
<a NAME="review"></a></p><p><br><i><b><font face="arial" color="Black" size="4">
Q:&nbsp&nbsp What happens if I go back to review my answer?</i></b><br>
</font></p><p><font face="arial" color="Black" size="3"><b>
A:&nbsp&nbsp The "back/forward" browser buttons may be used to review answers. However, if the "back" browser button is used and answers are changed, a pop-up box will appear alerting the user that previous answers may have to be re-entered.&nbsp&nbsp <cfinclude template="back2faq.cfm"></font>
</b></font>
<p>
<a NAME="programs"></a></p><p><br><i><b><font face="arial" color="Black" size="4">
Q:&nbsp&nbsp My session produced only a few programs.  What happened?</i></b><br>  
</font></p><p><font face="arial" color="Black" size="3"><b>
A:&nbsp&nbsp In order for your session to report programs, two things must occur. First, each question must be answered as accurately as possible. Second, the information that is entered must meet the criteria established for the programs. It is possible that a user's income and other circumstances would limit eligibility to just a few programs.&nbsp&nbsp <cfinclude template="back2faq.cfm"></font>
</b></font>
<p>
<a NAME="nolocal"></a></p><p><br><i><b><font face="arial" color="Black" size="4">
Q:&nbsp&nbsp My session listed programs, but they didn't mention any local contact agencies.</i></b><br>
</font></p><p><font face="arial" color="Black" size="3"><b>
A:&nbsp&nbsp This may have occurred because no ZIP code was entered.  The ZIP code is used to determine where the individual is located so the closest contact point can be given.  If no ZIP code is given, the system does provide a link to the entire listing of contacts for that program in the state.&nbsp&nbsp <cfinclude template="back2faq.cfm"></font>
</b></font>
<p>
<a NAME="print"></a></p><p><br><i><b><font face="arial" color="Black" size="4">
Q:&nbsp&nbsp I received the Results Overview and I reviewed each of the Program Details, but how can I print all of that information in a single document?</i></b><br>
</font></p><p><font face="arial"  color="Black" size="3"><b>
A:&nbsp&nbsp On the Results Overview page and toward the bottom of that page, there is a link to "View and Print Report." This will create a report that displays both the Results Overview as a table of contents, and the individual Program Details (with all of the relevant information). The reports can be large documents because each Program Detail is printed on its own page.&nbsp&nbsp <cfinclude template="back2faq.cfm"></font>
</b></font>
<p>
<a NAME="BOSS"></a></p><p><br><i><b><font face="arial" color="Black" size="4">
Q:&nbsp&nbsp How does <cf_tagBCU> differ from BOSS?</i></b></p><p> 
</font><font face="arial" color="Black" size="3"><b>
A:&nbsp&nbsp <cf_tagBCU> is the latest version of the technology that originally created BOSS (Benefit Outreach Screening Software).  <cf_tagBCU> is a fully online and national service (includes over 1,000 federal and state programs for all 50 states, including the District of Columbia); whereas BOSS was disk-based and a single-state product.  Because it was disk-based, BOSS was difficult to maintain. Because <cf_tagBCU> is able to take advantage of Internet-based technology, regular and consistent updates are standard.  <cf_tagBCU> is currently offered as only a senior benefit program. That means the programs included are available only to older Americans. Some versions of BOSS did include children's programs. While <cf_tagBCU> is new, it's built upon the nearly 15 years of BOSS's field experience.&nbsp&nbsp <cfinclude template="back2faq.cfm"> </font>
</b></font>
<p>
<a NAME="database"></a></p><p><br><i><b><font face="arial" color="Black" size="4">
Q:&nbsp&nbsp Who keeps the information in the database current?</i></b></p><p>
</font><font face="arial" color="Black" size="3"><b>
A:&nbsp&nbsp The data contained within the service (eligibility criteria, program descriptions, local contacts, and required materials) is managed centrally by a team in New York City.  Throughout the year, they collect existing program eligibility information and review new programs for potential inclusion.  In addition, the team is constantly verifying the local contact information acknowledging the constraints of their limited staff.  On a regular basis data is uploaded to keep the system up-to-date.&nbsp&nbsp <cfinclude template="back2faq.cfm"> </font> 
</b></font>
<p>
<a NAME="estimates"></a></p><p><br><i><b><font face="arial" color="Black" size="4">
Q:&nbsp&nbsp Since you are not a government agency, how do you know the estimates are accurate?</i></b></p><p>
</font><font face="arial" color="Black" size="3"><b>
A:&nbsp&nbsp NCOA worked with the federal and state benefit authorities (those individuals and organizations that actually enroll older adults in benefit programs) for nearly two years to collect the programs, relevant eligibility criteria and the information necessary to successfully complete an application.  Then once the system was developed, NCOA has tested it with experts on government programs, nonprofit organizations, state organizations and the federal agencies to determine its reliability.  All have given NCOA a solid rating that this service is indeed accurate.
<p>
A reminder, <cf_tagBCU> identifies programs for which you may be eligible. It does not determine your eligibility nor does it enroll you in any programs. You should verify your eligibility by contacting each agency to discuss your situation.&nbsp&nbsp <cfinclude template="back2faq.cfm"></font>
</b></font>
<p>
<a NAME="customize"></a></p><p><br><i><b><font face="arial" color="Black" size="4">
Q:&nbsp&nbsp This is an excellent service.  Is there a way I can customize it for my local community-based organization?</i></b></p><p>
</font><font face="arial" color="Black" size="3"><b>
A:&nbsp&nbsp Yes.  There are a few options you may want to consider.  First, there will be a professional version of this application offered soon. It will have additional features enabling professionals to enhance their service delivery.  Second, the technical team is able to build customized versions of the product.
