          <h2 tabindex="0">Is it safe to apply for Social Security Benefits over the
          Internet?</h2>

          <p tabindex="0">
            Social Security is taking all reasonable and proper measures, including encryption,
            to ensure that your personal information is disclosed only to you. However, the
            Internet is an open system and there is no absolute guarantee that others will not
            intercept the personal information you have entered or requested and decrypted.
            Although this possibility is remote, it does exist.
          </p>

          <h2 tabindex="0">What is encryption?</h2>

          <p tabindex="0">
          Encryption means that all information relating to you and your
          account is scrambled and locked with a mathematical key during
          the electronic transfer. Most browsers have an icon such as a key
          or a lock to represent an encrypted mode or session. A broken key,
          open lock, or no lock indicates that the session or mode is not
          encrypted.
          </p>

          <h2 tabindex="0">Why is special software necessary to access the Internet
          application?</h2>

          <p tabindex="0">
            So that your online request can remain confidential, Social Security uses a
            security protocol (method) called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for this application.
            You must use a Web browser that supports SSL. Netscape Navigator and Microsoft
            Internet Explorer are two browsers that support SSL. Using this security protocol,
            all information sent between your computer and our server is encrypted before
            being sent on the Internet.
          </p>

          <h2 tabindex="0">Why SSL?</h2>

          <p tabindex="0">
          SSL provides a high level of security and is the security protocol
          supported by more browsers than any other. It is estimated that
          about 92% of Web browsers have an SSL browser available for their
          use.
          </p>

          <p tabindex="0">
          We have found that a number of business, government, and
          educational networks do not have their firewalls configured to
          allow passage of secure Web traffic. Check with your systems
          administrator to determine if this is the case at your site. If
          this is the case you will not be able to access this application
          web site.
