              The following instructions are for users of screen readers such as JAWS and
              Window-Eyes and browser-based readers such as Home Page Reader. Filling out this
              application is best accomplished in a Forms or MSAA mode that allows you to tab
              to controls and fill in input boxes, radio buttons, check boxes and list boxes.
              Instructional text usually occurs at the beginning of these screens and can be
              accessed in non-MSAA or virtual-cursor mode. Tab indices have also been added
              to allow for tabbing through text. Additionally, consistent headers have been
              set up to access questions and examples/instructions more easily. The screen
              reader will indicate which questions have additional help or instructional text.
              You can then tab to the additional help or continue tabbing to the next question
              to bypass this help.
            </p>
            <p tabindex="0">
              Unless you have turned JavaScript off in your browser, you will receive a
              warning after 25 minutes and you can extend your time on the page. After the
              third warning, you must move to another page, or your time will run out and
              your work on that page will be lost.
            </p>
            <p tabindex="0">
              This application contains hotkeys to improve navigation and provide information. 
              On many screens there is a continue button at the end of the screen to allow
              you to go to the next page or a previous button to return to the prior page.
              The hotkey ALT + C is associated with the Continue button and ALT + P for the
              Previous button. Press ALT + C or ALT + P to move forward or back in Internet 
              Explorer. There is also a non-interactive progress indicator (ALT + G) which lets 
              you know the step of the application in which you are currently working. However, 
              the use of this hotkey forces you to leave your current position on the page as it 
              moves focus to the top, where the progress indicator is located. 
            </p>
            <p tabindex="0">
              Other keyboard commands, hotkeys or access keys will vary based upon browser and the
              version of that browser that you are using. A list of these commands can be
              found in the Help section of your browser.  The Help feature can be located on
              the Menu bar of your browser or by using the F1 function key on the keyboard.
              Any assistive devices that you may be using will also have a list of these
              shortcut keys in the Help section. Also see our
              <a href="http://eis.ba.ssa.gov/appages/dummylink.html"
              title="Keyboard Commands web page.">Keyboard Commands</a> web page.
            </p>
            <p tabindex="0">
              When you attempt to advance through the application with erroneous data or missing 
              information, the page will redisplay with a list of links at the top for each error.  
              Selecting these error links will take you directly to the field in question, placing 
              focus at the specific error control. The fixed error will not be deleted from the list of 
              links or error messages at the field until the page is re-submitted. To navigate to the next 
              error, invoke the screen reader or screen magnifier's links list or simply tab through the fields
              and listen to the screen reader to hear when there is an error message.
            </p>
            <p tabindex="0">
              There are instances where link and button names are repeated in an application like the following:
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li tabindex="0">More Info</li>
                <li tabindex="0">Edit</li>
                <li tabindex="0">Details</li>
              </ul>
            <p tabindex="0">
              These links usually have a title attribute that describes the link in more detail.
              In order for screen readers to speak this additional information, the screen reader
              must be set up to speak the title attribute instead of the screen text. Depending
              on the screen reader used, this can be a verbosity setting, configuration setting,
              set file, etc.  Please refer to the documentation for specific screen readers or
              browser readers if this procedure is unknown.
