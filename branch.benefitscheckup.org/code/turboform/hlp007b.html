              Example:
            </h3>
            <p tabindex="0">
              A relative paid your heating bills during the winter months of January through March and your heating
              bills were about $180 per month during those three months. This means that you received a total of $540
              in help during the year for your heating bills. However, you must enter the <strong>monthly</strong>
              average amount of this help on your application. To compute the monthly amount, divide $540 by 12 months,
              which is $45, and enter $45 as the monthly amount of help you received.
            </p>
            <p tabindex="0">
              If your heating bills were more than $193 per month, only use $193 when computing the average monthly amount.
              (Any help you received over $193 per month is not counted.) So, if the heating bills for January through March
              were about $300 per month, multiply $193 (not $300) by three months, which totals $579 for the year. Then
              divide $579 by 12, which is $48.25, and enter $48.25 as the monthly amount of help you received.
            </p>
            <p tabindex="0">
              If you occasionally receive help, such as your child buying groceries for the week, <strong>do NOT</strong>
              include that amount. Other examples of possible income sources that should <strong>NOT</strong> be counted are:
