Email message to Evaluators<BR><BR>
Hello (First Name) (Last Name) - <BR><BR>

We need your help.  As you know, the National Council on the Aging in June, 2001 launched the 'consumer' version of BenefitsCheckUp, the first national online screening service of public benefits for older adults. Even though nearly half a million people have accessed the service, we recognize that an online version has it's limitations in reaching some of the neediest older adults.  For that reason, among others, we created a second version of BenefitsCheckUp, which we call the Community Service Organization version (CSO).
<BR><BR>

We need your help to test it out.  To evaluate it.  To poke it and prode it before we release it to NCOA members across the country.  Can you help us by going through the application and completing an evaluation survey?
<BR><BR>

We'd like you to go through it as if you were setting up the service for your organization, inputing your organization's co-branding and local program information, going through the CSO version of BenefitsCheckUp screening service, and reviewing statistical output options.
<BR><BR>

We hope that you (and/or let me know of others within your organization and/or community that might be interested in evaluating) can help us today and in exchange we promise a discount to this service when it's made available later this year.  In addition, you can continue to use the service after the testing period is over.  Please note: that the system may be down periodically as we make modifications based upon your (and other evaluators') recommendations.
<BR><BR>

So join us in a historic event in social services...the creation of the nation's single entry point for organizations into federal and state-wide benefit programs for older adults...and be forever known as a "Alpha Tester" of the CSO version.  
<BR><BR>

As a way of saying thanks, we will hold a raffle at the conclusion of this testing period of all those that completed and submitted the evaluator's survey before midnight on February 28, 2002.  We will award five fifty dollar ($50) gift certificates from American Express to be used personally or given to your favorite charity.
<BR><BR>

Thank you and if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to send me an email (dave@benefitscheckup.org) or give me a call 877.766.5220 (toll free).
<BR><BR>

These are exciting times and we sincerely appreciate your assistance in enabling NCOA to realize our dream of increasing older adults' access to public benefits!
