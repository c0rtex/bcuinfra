<b>Alpha Tester Survey</b><br>

Thanks for taking the time to go through and evaluate the “alpha version” of The National Council on the Aging’s Community Service Organization (CSO) Version of BenefitsCheckUp.  These are exciting times and we appreciate your assistance in helping us make this service more usable and productive for community-based organizations across the country. Please complete the survey, as many times as you’d like, and provide as many details as possible to clearly describe your experiences and any suggestions.  As always, we can be reached for comment/help via email at: <a href="mailto:cso@benefitscheckup.org">cso@benefitscheckup.org</a>
