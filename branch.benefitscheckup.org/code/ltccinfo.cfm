<h2>More About Public Programs</h2>

<p>The public program section of the Long-Term Care Counselor (LTCC) will 
help you to learn about your eligibility for public programs that will 
help pay for long-term care services based on your financial resources 
and the programs available in your state.</p>

<p>Medicaid is the major state public program that pays for long-term care 
services. However, Medicaid is not just one program. Instead, Medicaid, 
under broad federal guidelines and state/federal funding support, has 
many programs that offer different coverage of services, for different 
categories of the population, with different eligibility requirements. 
Some states have other public programs that are funded with only state 
funds.</p>

<p>You will be asked detailed questions regarding the your age, health care 
needs and financial resources. All responses are confidential. Your 
information is not saved and you are not identified in any way. The 
questions are similar to the questions a long-term care specialist would 
ask.</p>

<p>Based on your responses, LTCC will identify public programs in your 
state that offer coverage of long-term care services for older adults. 
In addition to identifying the programs that you may be eligible to 
receive, LTCC also provides a detailed description of the programs, 
local contacts for additional information, and materials to help 
successfully apply for each program.</p>
