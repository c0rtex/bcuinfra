<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<cf_tagClose>
<p>
Now that you have your report containing information about public benefit programs, what's next? Here are a few simple steps that will get you on your way to accessing the benefits that will help you.</p>
<p>Thoroughly review your <b><cf_tagBCU></b> report. On practically every page, it explains the benefits you may be eligible for, provides local contact information, and lists the materials necessary for applying. Review these programs to prioritize those that are most important and would impact your life most significantly.</p>
<p>Organize the benefit programs by local contact. Each benefits program is presented separately. You may notice how it is possible to obtain information and/or apply for multiple benefits from the same local organization. This may save you time and reduce your number of phone calls.</p>
<p>Contact the local organizations provided. While we try to keep an accurate and comprehensive list of tens of thousands of local contacts nationwide, these organizations move frequently. Call, when possible, to confirm the office location and ask any questions you may have; this way, you will be as prepared as possible when you visit.</p>
<p>Collect all necessary materials prior to applying. We can't emphasize enough how important it is to have all the documentation available when applying for benefits. This speeds up the application process tremendously.</p>
