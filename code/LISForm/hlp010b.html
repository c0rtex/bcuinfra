              refer to your policy package. For example, if you

              You do <strong>not</strong> have to turn in your life

              If the total face value of all your life insurance policies is
              $1,500 or less, we do not need to know about them. The face
              value of the policy is the amount the insurance company would
              pay if you pass away.
            </p>
            <p tabindex="0">
              If the total face value of your policies is more than $1,500, we
              need to know how much the insurance company would pay if you
              cashed in the policy. This is known as the cash value of the
              policy.
            </p>
            <p tabindex="0">
              To find out the cash value of your policies, look at each
              policy. If the policy says something like, "This policy has no
              cash value," enter "0" in the field that asks for the value.
              If the policy has a cash value, the policy may include a table
              that says what the value is based on and how many years you
              have owned the policy. If so, enter the value shown in the
              table. If you have more than one policy, enter the total value of
              all of the policies.
            </p>
            <p tabindex="0">
              If your policies do not have a cash value table, contact your
              insurance agent or the insurance company to find out the cash
              value of the policies.

              If you cannot determine the cash value on your policies and
