<b>Welcome Alpha Testers!</b><BR><BR>

These are truly exciting times.  With nearly one half million people already accessing the consumer version of BenefitsCheckUp, the need for this technology is proven.  Now to support organizations in serving those that don't have Internet access....<BR><BR>

Thank you for testing this, the Community Service Organization version of BenefitsCheckUp, and for helping us ensure it is sufficiently user-friendly and compelling that community-based organizations across the country will seek to and easily integrate this service into their daily operations. <BR><BR>

As this is the first release of the application, we know it is not "bug" free.  In fact, there are a few components that are not currently working and they are not included in this test. (We'll notify you when they are working properly.) There is an "<A HREF="http://test.benefitscheckup.org/AlphaTesters/issuesboard.html" target="blank">Issues Board</a>" where we are tracking the issues that are reported and their status. <BR><BR>

Before you start your evaluation, we recommend that you review the <a href="http://test.benefitscheckup.org/AlphaTesters/survey.cfm" target=blank>Alpha Tester Survey</A>, so that you can see some of the things we'd like you to pay special attention to while you go through the application.  You can submit as many surveys as you would like; we want all your feedback.<BR><BR>

As a way of saying thanks, we will hold a raffle at the conclusion of this testing for five $50 American Express gift certificates.  A completed survey is your ticket to win.  If your completed survey is received before midnight on 2/28/02, you'll be entered in the drawing.  Winners will receive an email and instructions on how to obtain their gift certificate.<BR><BR>

<a href="http://test.benefitscheckup.org/AlphaTesters/instructions.htm" target=blank>A Tester's Guide</a>.  To faciliate your testing, we've created a short guide, like a tip sheet and reference manual, to speed your set-up and use of the application.  This guide supplements other support, which can easily be found in the lower right-hand corner of every page of the site.  Look for the link "Need help with this page," which provides helpful information in processing through the page that you are on.<BR><BR>

At the bottom of every CSO page, there are two links "Email Developers" and "Alpha Testers' Survey."  At any point throughout the application you can use these links to contact us with any questions and/or suggestions that you might have.  We value all of your opinions and critiques.  We know that the only way to build an amazing and quickly adaptable tool is to make it very easy to use. We need your help to do that.  If you don't understand something tell us.  If you think we could do something more simply, tell us what and how.  If we aren't doing something that we should be, please let us know.  <BR><BR>

Thanks So Much!<BR>
