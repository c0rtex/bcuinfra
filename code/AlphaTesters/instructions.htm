<DD><LI>Be straight-forward and detail orientated in your evaluation.  The more we resolve now the better users will appreciate and benefit from the application.
<DD><LI>Kindly review the application from many angles:  
<UL><LI>as you would use it, 
<LI>as others in your organization might use it (whether they are case managers, volunteers, or decision makers), 
<LI>how your community members might use it, and 
<LI>as someone trying to "break" it … that is try everything and see that it works the way it intuitively should.
<LI>Specifically, please read through the "Help in using this Page" links and let us know how helpful our online support is.  Any suggestions for improvement are sincerely appreciated and it's best to email those to us.

<B><A NAME="brief">Brief Overview</a></b><BR>
As you may know, NCOA launched BenefitsCheckUp, the nation's first online public benefit screening service covering all the major federal and state-wide programs for older adults (approximately 1,000 programs), on June 5, 2001 to rave reviews.  In fact, nearly 500,000 have used the service since it launched six months ago.  NCOA was thrilled, but also recognized that not every older adult, and particularly those with the greatest need, would have access to the Internet.  Therefore, a second version was sought that would work with community-based organizations, and provide them with additional features and functionality to enable them to serve as effective "intermediaries" to those older adults that didn't have access to the Internet for whatever reason: accessibility issues, language issues, comprehension issues, computer phobias, etc.  The CSO version has many enhancements.<BR>

<DL>  
<DT>These include:
<DD><LI>Ability to Add/Edit Local Organizational Information - each CSO location can add material about their organization and local programs/services it provides to the community.  This information would be included in the printed report.
<DD><LI>Co-Brand & Identity Building - each CSO can add their logo and name to be displayed on every page of the onscreen application of both the administrative screens and the BenefitsCheckUp screens.  In addition, the organization's logo and contact information would be displayed predominately on the cover of the printed report.
<DD><LI>Statistical Reports - each CSO is able to retrieve reports on the number of individuals that were screened, their basic demographic information, and what programs were returned.  This information is assembled into easy to create reports.  In addition, lead agencies in an area can automatically aggregate several CSOs data into a single report.
<DD><LI>Printed Report - To better enable CSOs to serve those without Internet access, each CSO would be able to print a version of the questionnaire.  This version of the questionnaire orders the questions differently.  In addition, there is a special single page input screen making it easier for CSO staff to enter a user's answers. 
<DD><LI>News Service - NCOA will make announcements through this service of benefit changes and general broad-based communications.  Each CSO can also use this service to distribute news/information (trainings, success stories, etc.) to the staff of the organization.
<DD><LI>Access Control - Security is important and the CSO version of BenefitsCheckUp created several different levels of access.  These levels are assigned in a user-friendly way with predefined "roles" to make things simpler.  One level of access is for the person who manages all of the organizational information on the site, including the local program text.  Another person may be a volunteer, who only needs to access the screening and printable reports.  Each CSO is free to make further customizations as needed.

First, Thank you.  As with so many products and services before, they are not possible and certainly not successful without the assistance of honest, professional, critical, understanding, probing, inquisitive and thoughtful evaluators.  We think you are such a person and we welcome, if not insist, on your very open and honest feedback.  Only then will we together make the CSO service be all that it can be.  (cheesy I know, but true).<BR><BR>

<I>Username and Password</i><BR>
In the email inviting you to participate in this alpha test, you were given two randomly generated Login IDs.  This id is to be used as your username and password.  These are temporary and you'll be asked to change them. Please note the requirements of the password (e.g. at least 6 characters, etc.)  <BR><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Web Site Address:   <A HREF="http://csotest.benefitscheckup.org/">http://csotest.BenefitsCheckUp.org/</a></b><BR><BR></blockquote>

<I>Login Page</i><BR>
There are a few things to point about this page, as this page contains the basic template for how all pages will be displayed.  There is the top NCOA banner, where the CSO logo and name will be displayed once the organization has logged in (if they select to display one).  The NCOA national sponsors appear only on this page and the printed report.  There's a link to NCOA, should a visitor come to this page and either have problems connecting or needs to sign-up with NCOA as an organizational member.  Below the login information there's a link that will guide the user through an online help session to remember/retrieve your access information.  To the right is NCOA news where current events, special announcements and notices will be placed for all CSO users to view.  Just above the footer, are the navigational links for the site.  Depending upon the page there are between two and four links.  Always to the far left is a link to NCOA's homepage and always to the far right is a link to "Help in using this page."  Also, please note that at the bottom of every page are links to "Email Developers" and the "Alpha Testers' Survey."  They are provided to easy your communication with us during this testing period.<BR><BR>

<I>Help in Using this Page</i><BR>
In the bottom, far right of every page is a link titled "Help in using this page."  In each situation, this link describes the activities/functions/processes and defines terminology on each particular page.  From a tester's perspective, we are very eager to know if you found these pages helpful. <BR><BR>

<I>What To Do Once You're Logged In</I><BR>
Once logged in you'll be prompted to create a new organizational profile.  When you arrive at the "Add Organization Profile" page you'll notice that some of the information is already populated.  That information was transmitted from NCOA's membership database to help keep the two systems synchronized.  Please note that those fields marked with a red asterisk (*) are required fields and must be completed or you will be prompted to complete them.  These prompts are throughout the CSO version to assist the user in entering their information.<BR><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<I>Completing "Add Organization Profile"</I><BR>
	There are two locations to add contact information, because the first set of information is private and that information is only used between that CSO user, their organization and NCOA.  The other area of contact information is the information that's displayed on the printed report and will be accessible by other CSOs across the country.  Here is where the CSO is able to add their co-branding information (description of the organization, slogan, etc.), and there is a button the user selects to add their logo or local program information.<BR><BR>

If you would like to practice using the "Add or Change Logo" features but don't have a logo to use, we've created some samples for you.  Visit: <A HREF="http://test.benefitscheckup.org/AlphaTesters/logos.htm">sample logos</a>. <BR><BR>

	<I>Adding New Users</I><BR>
	Here is where the other staff/volunteers of the organization are identified and given roles in using the application.  The different roles determine what options and to what degree the individual is able to work with the specific functionality.  <BR><BR>
</blockquote>

<I>Main Menu (CSO Home)</i><BR>
Once the user is logged into the system this is the next screen that appears.  Depending upon the organization's choice, this page will or won't contain any "CSO News," which is similar to NCOA News, except created and maintained by the CSO.  There are three major areas of functionality on this page: Maintenance, Reports, and Questionnaire.  Please refer to the "Help in using this page" for more information about the specific functionality/utility of these major areas.<BR><BR>

<I>Data Sharing</i><BR>
The data sharing functionality allows organizations to share their information with each other to create a single aggregate report for an area.  That is to suggest that one lead agency within a community can automatically collect the data on the activity of organizations within its area, and therefore more easily analyze and report that information.  To build the trust and respect within an area, each organization must agree to and enable another organization to access its data.
<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Set-Up to Share</I><BR>
Each organization must "authorize" and/or "enable" another organization to share its data.  To do so, the organization must identify the organization that is allowed to share its data.  That process is made possible on this screen, where users are first given the opportunity to select the organization using a couple of different criteria: zip code, state and/or city.  Once either one of these criteria is entered, a pop-up window displays the organizations matching that criteria is preceeded by check boxes.  The user checks which of the organizations (one or all of them) it wants to allow to share their data.  A list will appear of those organizations that have been authorized to share your data.  By clicking on the "remove" link to the right of an organization you will prevent that organization's ability to access your data.  There is a 72 hour time delay on this activity, to ensure the removal is purposeful.<BR><BR>

Also on this page, is a link "List Organizations Allowing This CSO to Access Their Data for Reports" which displays those organizations whose data is aggregated into a single report generated by this organization. 
</blockquote>


<I>Reports</i><BR>
There are three types of reports generated.  The first is a "statistical/demographic" report mostly describing the activity and type of users who were screened in this current period (a month), the last period, the year to date (if the report is generated in July, then it would be a tally of users since January), and the total (if the service has been operating for three years, four months, it would provide the total for that entire three year, four month period).  The second report is on the benefit information that was returned to users.   In both situations, users can slice the particular statistical information via several criteria, which are requested before the report is generated.  For example, a report can be generated aggregating all satellite and shared information, or these reports individually; or a report could be generated looking at just one program (for all shared organizations or just one), etc.<BR><BR>

The third report is our first attempt to facilitate the collection of follow-up information.  We look at this report as a work in progress.  This report is divided into two sections.  The first generates a page, which lists only those programs that have been returned in the last period.  The second section is an input screen that is identical to the report simplifying data entry.<BR><BR>
