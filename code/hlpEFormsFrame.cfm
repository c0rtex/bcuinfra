This option allows you to go through your selections one by one.  This option also includes the electronic forms that you selected, if any.<br><br>

Please note the information windows located in the border above your Fact Sheets, Blank Forms or Electronic Forms as these provide critical information to assist you in navigating through each type of Fact Sheet or Form.<br><br>

<b>At First Item</b> - This information window will always let you know when you are at the first document.<br><br>

<b>Previous Item</b> - This allows you to click through to the previous Blank Form, Electronic Form or Fact sheet, before or after printing the current document.  The information window below tells you the name of the previous document.<br><br>

<b>Print This Item</b> - This means you have chosen to print out a Blank Form and should complete that function now.  The information window below tells you the name of the document.<br><br>

<b>Next Item</b> - This allows you to click through to the next Blank Form, Electronic Form or Fact sheet, before or after printing the current document.  The information window below tells you the name of the next document.<br><br>

<b>Application Guide</b> - This allows you to return to the Application Guide and make different selections.  This can be done at any point in the process.<br><br>

<b>At E-form (or electronic form)</b> - This version of an application form allows you to fill out the requested information on-line prior to printing out the form.  You must use the "Next Page" button at the bottom to advance through an e-form.  Once you have filled out the requested information on an e-form, then like information will be carried over to the next e-form, thus saving you time and effort.  Only information that is unique to a particular form will need to be filled out individually.<br><br>

<b>At Last Item</b> - This information window tells you that you have navigated through all of the Fact Sheets and Forms that you selected.  You can click "Return to Application Guide" if you want to review that information or close down the browser window.  If you chose to close down the browser window, then all of your information is lost and cannot be retrieved.<br><br><br>
