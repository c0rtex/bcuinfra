<h2 align="center"><strong> Why These Cards? </strong></h2>
<p><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><font size=+1> Some background </font></strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to help you find the best combination of prescription savings programs&#151;including the Medicare-approved drug discount cards&#151;that will save you the most money on your medications. </p>

<p>Medicare offers extra help through these drug cards for people who have low incomes. These are people who: </p>
<ul>
  <li>don't have other prescription coverage (through Medicaid or through a plan from a former employer), AND </li>
  <li> have monthly income less than or equal to $1,077 if they are single, or $1,444 if married (for people living in one of the 48 contiguous states) OR </li>
  <li> have monthly income less than or equal to $1,345 if they are single, or $1,804 if married (for people living in Alaska) OR </li>
  <li> have monthly income less than or equal to $1,239 if they are single, or $1,661 if married (for people living in Hawaii) </li>
</ul>
<p>If this describes you, you may qualify for additional assistance on your Medicare-approved drug discount card that you can use to pay for your prescriptions in 2005.  The amount of the additional assistance offered depends on when you apply for the card.  If you apply between: </p>

<ul>
<li>January 1 - March 31, 2005 you will get $600; </li>
<li>April 1 - June 30, 2005 you will get $450; </li>
<li>July 1 - September 30, 2005 you will get $300; or</li>
<li>October 1 - December 31, 2005 you will get $150. </li>
</ul>

<p>Even though this additional assistance is sometimes called a "credit," you do not need to pay it back.</p>
<p><strong><font size=+1>So why did you pick these cards for me? </font></strong></p>
<p>Finding the Medicare-approved drug discount card that offers you the best discounts on the medications you're taking is important. But many people have drug costs that are far more than the additional assistance in a year. So what happens once that additional assistance is used up is even <em>more</em> important for people with low incomes. </p>

<p>Some drug companies have programs offering extra help with over 200 different medications after your additional assistance is gone. These programs are sometimes called "wraparound" programs because they "wrap around" the additional assistance and start covering you once it is used up. For drugs covered by these programs, you will pay only a small monthly fee (usually about $12-15) for a 30-day supply. </p>

<p> We take a look at the list of medicines you're taking and recommend a list of up to 3 card(s) that will provide you with the most help once your additional assistance is used up.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong></strong> But not every card is accepted at every pharmacy.&nbsp; So we try to recommend more than one card so that you can choose one that is taken at the pharmacy you like to use. </p>

<p>If there are more than 3 cards that will give you the same level of help, then our tool will randomly select a list of 3 cards for you to choose from.  </p>

<p><strong><font size=+1> What if my medications are not covered by one of these "wraparound" programs?</font></strong></p>
<p>If you qualify for the additional assistance, but your medications are not covered by one of the wraparound programs, we recommend that you sign up for a Medicare-approved drug discount card with the additional assistance, and we pick 3 cards at random for you to consider. If you take very expensive medications, we suggest that you visit <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/">www.Medicare.gov</a> so that you can compare prices and discounts offered by the different Medicare drug cards. </p>
