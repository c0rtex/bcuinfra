<B>NCOA Announces Free Online Service <BR>
Helps Older Americans Access Programs<BR></B>
Seniors Can Now Freely Access Benefits Information Through http://www.BenefitsCheckUp.org<BR><BR>

The National Council on the Aging has launched a free, easy-to-use online service that helps older Americans identify both federal and state assistance programs that may vastly improve the quality of their lives.<BR><BR>

Nearly 1.2 million seniors qualify for but don't receive Social Security; 3 million never receive the Medicaid assistance they deserve and 3.7 million qualify for but do not receive food stamps.<BR><BR>

<cf_tagBCU> helps older Americans find these and other government programs, providing visitors the information they need to access services such as education, employment and volunteer opportunities, financial assistance, health care, home care or housing assistance, and food programs. The service is not only free of charge, it is also confidential.<BR><BR>

This kind of comprehensive search used to take as much as 10 weeks. With <cf_tagBCU>, it takes 10 minutes. Over 1,000 different programs are included in the database from all 50 states, including the District of Columbia.<BR><BR>

Seniors can now find <cf_tagBCU> &#151; the popular online service for seniors &#151; by visiting http://www.BenefitsCheckUp.org. <BR><BR>

Founded in 1950, NCOA is a private, nonprofit association of organizations and individuals dedicated to promoting dignity, self-determination, well being and continuing contributions of older persons through leadership and service, education and advocacy. NCOA members include senior centers, adult day service centers, senior housing, congregate-meal sites, faith congregations and area agencies on aging. Over the past 50 years, NCOA has helped to develop dozens of innovative programs such as Foster Grandparents, Meals on Wheels, and Family Friends that serve the needs of older Americans and their families.
