<h3>What Should I Do If A Medication Is Not Listed?</h3>

<cf_tagClose>

<p>If you are unable to find your medication, we suggest you
take the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Double check for correct spelling.</b><br>

Many drug names are complicated. Having just one incorrect
letter can prevent you from locating your medication. Have your medication bottle available to verify correct spelling.<br><br>

<li><b>Seek professional advice</b><br>

There are many assistance programs but unfortunately they
are not available for all prescription drugs. If an assistance program is not
available for your prescription drug, there may be similar products for which
an assistance program is available. Speak with your doctor, pharmacist, or
other health care provider to see if they can suggest a possible alternative
product that your doctor could prescribe.  If it seems likely that you may
be eligible for an assistance program under the alternate medication name, ask
your healthcare provider if it would be safe to take the alternate medication.<br><br>

<li><b>Contact the
pharmaceutical company</b><br>

You can contact the
pharmaceutical company (company that makes your medication) directly to find
out if they have an assistance program for your medication.  Your healthcare provider can help you
identify which company makes your medication.<br><br>

<li><b>Check www.BenefitsCheck<i>Up</i>.org's Rx Screening often</b><br>

We will continually
be adding medications, alternate medication names and assistance programs.<br><br>

</ol>
