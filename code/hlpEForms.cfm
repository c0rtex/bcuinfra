<b>FACT SHEETS</b><br>
You can select to print out <b><u>all</u></b> fact sheets by clicking <b>"on"</b> under the "Fact Sheet" column heading.  (That will put a check mark in each square.)<br><br>

You can select to print out <b><u>no</u></b> fact sheets by clicking <b>"off"</b> under the "Fact Sheet" column heading.  (That will make each square blank.)<br><br>

You can choose which fact sheets you want printed by independently clicking on each square.<br><br>

<b>BLANK FORMS</b><br>
Blank forms are program application forms, which can be printed out and filled out by hand.  (You need to have the program Adobe Acrobat Reader on your computer in order to retrieve these forms.)  You can select which forms you want by clicking on the round button.  If you want all of the forms you can click <b>"all"</b> under the "Blank Form" column heading.  If you want just certain blank forms then click on the round button associated with the selected program.<br><br>

<b>ELECTRONIC FORMS</b><br>
Electronic forms are forms, which can be filled out on-line and information of like kind is shown on each of the following  forms selected, thus saving you the work of filling out the same information more than once.  Information sections, which are unique to a particular form, will still need to be filled out on-line or by hand, after the form is printed out.<br><br>

<b>NO FORMS</b><br>
If you do not want any blank forms or electronic forms then you can click <b>"all"</b> under the "No Form" column heading.  If you want to select no forms for just certain programs, then click on the round button associated with that program.<br><br><br>
