<h3>Important Information about Prescription Medications</h3>

<cf_tagClose>

We are fortunate that a large number of safe and helpful prescription medications are available to treat many of today's  illnesses.

Medications can improve the quality of your life by preventing illness and decreasing disease complications.  They often prevent more costly medical interventions, such as surgery.
<BR><BR>

Unfortunately, medication-related problems, including adverse reactions and interactions between different medications may occur when using prescription drugs. These problems may occur more often in seniors, due to the increased number and types of medications they take. They may lead to harmful situations such as confusion and falls.  However, most medication-related problems are preventable by using the medications correctly.
<BR><BR>

To get the greatest benefit from your prescription medications and decrease your chances of having a problem: take only medications that are prescribed for you; don't take medications prescribed  for others; and check with your health care professional before taking non-prescription (over the counter) medications.
<BR><BR>
Whenever you have any questions about your medications, don't hesitate to ask your pharmacist or other health care professional.
