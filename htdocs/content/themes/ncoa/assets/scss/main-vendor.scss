// In October 2016 Sass was used to create the BenefitsCheckup.org website.
// Afterwards Sass was not used, and CSS updates were made directly to the
// compiled CSS file.
// In May 2017, while doing some major updates to the site with a new agency,
// it was decided to use Sass once again.
// However since the compiled CSS file had received a large amount of updates
// since October 2016, the decision was made to convert the compiled CSS into
// a single partial, and archive the old Sass partials.
