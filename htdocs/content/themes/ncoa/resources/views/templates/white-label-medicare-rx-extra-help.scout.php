      <p>The Medicare Prescription Drug program (also known as Part D) gives you a choice of prescription plans that offer various types of coverage. It also offers Extra Help with prescription drug costs for people with Medicare who have limited incomes and resources. Depending on your income and resources, you may be able to get help paying for your monthly premiums, annual deductible, and the cost of medications covered by your plan, providing you an average value of $4,000 per year. However, to get this help, you must be enrolled in a Medicare Prescription Drug plan. If you apply for and get the Extra Help and you have not yet enrolled in a Medicare Prescription Drug plan (Part D), you may temporarily get prescription drug coverage through Medicareâ€™s Limited Income NET (LI NET) Program. This program was created by Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) to eliminate gaps in prescription drug coverage for low-income Medicare Beneficiaries. The LI NET program is temporary and can only help you for a short time (usually about 2 months). If after this time, you have not chosen a Part D plan, CMS will automatically enroll you into one. For more information about LI NET, go to: www.Humana.com/LINET or call (800) 783-1307.</p>

      <p>You also may be able to get help from your State with other Medicare costs under the Medicare Savings Programs. By completing this online application for Extra Help, you will start the application process for a Medicare Savings Program. SSA will send information from your Extra Help application to your State, unless you tell SSA not to when you complete this form. Someone from your State will contact you to help you complete your Medicare Savings Program application.</p>
